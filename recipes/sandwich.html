    <p>Two pieces of bread with grilled cheese between them.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 slices white bread</li>

            bread slices over hot butter in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Spread about 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese on 1 bread slice; place other bread slice,
